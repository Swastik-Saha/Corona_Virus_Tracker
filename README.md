# Corona_Virus_Tracker
This is a Coronavirus Tracker python script
This will make a text file in its current working directory and will show the location where the file is saved
The file will be updated if its already made.
The name of the file will be 'Coronavirus_cases_data.txt'
The text file will contain the latest coronavirus cases in different countries.
Please star my project.
